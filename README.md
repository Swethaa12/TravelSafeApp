  <i>An Android app to send an SMS to a given contact, when you arrive home safely from a night out</i><br>
</p>


## About
Do your friends ever say, "text me when you're home safe" after a night out?
You get home, then crash out, and forget to message them, only for them to phone you in a panic a few hours later.

This app aims to solve this, by automatically sending a message to a specified contact, when you arrive at a certain geo location.

It can also be used for sending messages whenever you get to a certain physical location, for example:
- Automatically letting your partner know you'll be home in 20 minutes when you reach the train station
- Letting your mum know you've got to school safely 
- Texting your friend when you've made it to the bar
