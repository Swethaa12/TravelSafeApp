## About
Do your parents ever say, "text me when you reach home after work" ?
You get home, then forget to message them, only for them to phone you in a panic a few hours later.

This app aims to solve this, by automatically sending a message to a specified contact, when you arrive at a certain geo location.

It can also be used for sending messages whenever you get to a certain physical location, for example:
- Automatically letting your family partner know you'll be home in 20 minutes when you reach the bus stop
- Letting your mum know you've got to hostel safely
- Letting them know you have not reached home, if you encountered any accident/kidnapping.
